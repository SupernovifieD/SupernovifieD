- 👋 Hi, I’m Yasin. You could call me Yas. (he, his, him)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning in general. But specifically, I'm interested in answering questions related to big data and how it could be analyzed, and also deep boring questions about life and meaning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, especially with `python` and `django`. I've been introduced to programming quite recently, so I'm busy building a solid mindset in this field currently.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis methods in the realm of geosciences.
- 📫 You could go for @SupernovifieD all across the web, and you could find me quite easily. Drop me a line, and I'd be more than happy to chat.
